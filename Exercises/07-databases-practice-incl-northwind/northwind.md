# Northwind

Northwind is a classic training database, from Microsoft.

I have reformatted Northwind to use a Rails-style naming convention.

You can download the [SQL dump](https://github.com/elizabrock/software-development-curriculum/blob/master/computer-science/databases/northwind_rails_style.sql) and import it into the SQLite database browser of your choice.
