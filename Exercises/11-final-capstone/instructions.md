# Final Capstone

This is the final capstone for this class.

Project Criteria:

* Pick a project you're excited about!
* This is the ultimate resume piece that you will be showing to employers, so take that into consideration.


The sky is the limit for project ideas.  However, I will be helping you limit the initial scope of your projects.

Some project ideas can be gleaned from the Ruby capstone projects.  However, the project possibilities for this project are so much broader than the command-line applications, so you certainly shouldn't limit yourself to that.

## Milestone 1: Pick a Project

## Milestone 2: Create wireframes and user stories

## Milestone 3: Deploy your first feature

## Milestone 4: Project Presentations
