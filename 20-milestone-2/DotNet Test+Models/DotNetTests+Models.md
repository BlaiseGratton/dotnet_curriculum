### Model
* Data Annotations & Regex
* ORM / Entity Framework / Repository
* Testing (including Mocks)
* Patterns
* ApplicationUser vs. MyAppsUser

#### Business logic goes into Repository.

### Testing
* Test one method at a time - it goes in // Action of test.
* Need to come up with // Assert.
* Figuring out how to // Arrange is the hard part (to get it to run).
